# Architecture

[← Back to Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)

Porthole is designed as a monolithic, single-artifact application for simplicity of deployment.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java (virtual threads enabled)
- **Docker Client**: [docker-java](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java) with `ZeroDepDockerHttpClient` (Unix Socket support)
- **Build Tool**: Maven

### Client
- **Framework**: React
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Modern, Variables-based)
- **State**: React Query + LocalStorage (for user preferences)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Build Process

The client and server are built independently, then combined into a GraalVM native executable:

1. **Client Build**: `npm run build` produces a static bundle in `client/dist/`.
2. **Resource Copying**: Maven copies `client/dist` into `server/target/classes/static` via the `copy-client` profile.
3. **Native Compilation**: GraalVM compiles the combined application into a native executable.

The client and server builds are decoupled — in CI the client artifact is produced in a separate job and passed to the server build. Locally, `make bundle-native` runs both steps in sequence.

The final Docker image runs a single native binary with no JVM required.

## Native Image Hints

GraalVM native compilation requires explicit configuration for reflection, proxies, JNI, and resource access that cannot be statically inferred. These hints live in:

```
server/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/com.roomelephant/porthole/reachability-metadata.json
```

### Automated generation

Hints are generated automatically by a dedicated Maven profile (`generate-native-hints`) that runs the integration test suite with the GraalVM native-image agent attached to the app container. The agent observes all runtime reflection and writes the output directly to the source-tree path via a volume mount. No manual post-processing is required.

```
mvn verify -Pgenerate-native-hints
    │
    ├── failsafe passes system property: native.agent.output.dir=<source-tree path>
    │
    ├── PortholeContainer (if property set):
    │     ├── env: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/tmp/native-hints
    │     └── volume: <source-tree path> → /tmp/native-hints (READ_WRITE)
    │
    ├── ITs run normally (all *IT.java classes)
    │
    └── on container stop → agent flushes hint files → appear on host immediately
```

The `Dockerfile.jvm` uses a GraalVM JDK 25 community image so the agent is available in the IT container. Regular IT runs (`-Pintegration-tests`) are unaffected — the agent is a no-op unless `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is set, which only happens under the generation profile.

### Spring AOT hints

`DockerNativeConfig` (`server/src/main/java/.../config/nativehints/DockerNativeConfig.java`) registers additional Spring AOT hints for `docker-java` model classes and `@ConfigurationProperties` beans that are bound reflectively by Jackson or Hibernate Validator. This covers types that the agent cannot observe because they are never instantiated during the IT run.

### JVM vs Native Integration Tests

The integration test suite runs twice in the pipeline, each time against a different runtime:

| | CI (`reusable-server.yml`) | Release (`native-it` job) |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | JVM JAR (`Dockerfile.jvm`) | Native binary (`docker/Dockerfile`) |
| **Trigger** | Every push / PR to `main` | Every release tag |
| **Purpose** | Catch logic and API bugs fast | Catch AOT/native-image failures |

A feature can pass all JVM tests and still fail in native. GraalVM AOT compilation requires explicit configuration for reflection, proxies, and JNI — any class or method not registered will be missing at runtime. These failures are invisible on the JVM because the JVM resolves everything dynamically.

Running the same IT suite against the native binary surfaces missing reflection config, incomplete AOT hints, or `ClassNotFoundException`s before the image is pushed. Both runs are necessary; neither substitutes for the other.

## CI/CD Pipelines

### CI Workflow

Three separate workflows run on push/PR to `main`, each triggered by path filters:

- **ci-server.yml**: Builds and tests the backend — triggered by `server/**` changes. Runs integration tests against the JVM JAR (`Dockerfile.jvm`) for fast feedback on business logic and API correctness.
- **ci-client.yml**: Builds and tests the frontend — triggered by `client/**` changes.
- **ci-docker.yml**: Verifies the Docker image build — triggered by `docker/**` changes.

### Release Workflow

Runs when a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed:

- **server-check / client-check / docker-check**: Same checks as CI — run in parallel as a gate before the binary build.
- **build-binary** *(matrix: amd64, arm64)*: Sets the project version, downloads the pre-built client artifact, and compiles the GraalVM native executable. Uploads the binary as an artifact.
- **native-it** *(matrix: amd64, arm64)*: Downloads the native binary, builds a production Docker image (`docker/Dockerfile`), and runs the full integration test suite against it. The registry push is gated behind this job — a failing IT blocks the release.
- **push-image** *(matrix: amd64, arm64)*: Builds and pushes architecture-specific images to GHCR.
- **manifest**: Creates a multi-arch manifest combining the two images, pushes the version tag (and `latest` for stable releases), and creates the GitHub Release with the native binaries attached.

The Docker image is published to GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/room-elephant/porthole`.

See `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the full workflow definition.

## Docker Runtime Design

### Base Image Strategy
Given a standard GraalVM native-image build (glibc-based, dynamically linked), **`debian:bookworm-slim`** is the correct runtime choice instead of Alpine.
- **Reason**: The native binary built by GraalVM is dynamically linked against `glibc` (present in the build stage).
- **Compatibility**: Alpine uses `musl`, which makes it incompatible with standard glibc-linked binaries without complex static linking configurations.
- **Trade-off**: Bookworm-slim offers a stable, multi-arch foundation and is relatively small (~75MB), providing a good balance between size and compatibility.

### Permissions & Security

To run the application as a non-root user while minimising container-level privileges and enabling optional access to the host Docker daemon:

1. **Build Time**:
   - Creates a `nonroot` user with UID/GID 65532.
   - **No privileged group memberships are baked into the image.**

2. **Run Time (Entrypoint)**:
   - The container starts as `root` to perform one-time setup.
   - **Docker Socket Detection**: If `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted, the entrypoint inspects its owning GID.
   - **Root Ownership (GID 0)**:
     - If the socket is owned by `root` (GID 0), often the case for Docker Desktop or rootless setups, the container **stays as root**.
     - This ensures seamless access without complex group mapping in these environments.
   - **Dynamic Group Reconciliation** (if GID != 0):
     - If the socket's GID does not exist in the container, a group (`dockersock-<GID>`) is created.
     - The `nonroot` user is added to this group if not already a member.
     - **Privilege Drop**: The entrypoint switches to the `nonroot` user via `gosu` before launching the application.
   - **Access Verification**: A read/write check is performed to warn about potential permission issues.

The application process itself runs without root privileges and is granted only the minimum group access required to communicate with the host's Docker daemon when the socket is mounted.

> [!NOTE]
> Access to `/var/run/docker.sock` effectively grants control over the host Docker daemon. This setup limits container privileges but does not provide isolation from the host.

| `/api/containers/{containerId}/version` | GET    | Returns version info for a container (current version, latest version, update availability) |
| `/actuator/health`                      | GET    | Health check with Docker connectivity status                                                |
